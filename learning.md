#### I liked these analogies (Shout out to Reddit posts for explaining tech in an easy-to-understand type of way)
CPU: Is a super-talented mathematician  
Memory: The scratchpad the CPU uses to work out the math  
Disk: The filing cabinet. Very slow compared to memory. Holds all the math problem worksheets and answer sheets.  
GPU: It's a calculator that is good at performing a gigantic amount of simple-ish calculations all at once.  

#### What is React?
"React is a Javascript Library that was created by Facebook for building better User Interface(UI) web applications and mobile applications. It is an open-source library for creating interactive and dynamic applications."

### Installing Node.js on Linux for Ubuntu / Debian-based distributions:  
1. Update your package index: sudo apt update
2. Install Node.js and npm: sudo apt install nodejs npm
   You can use the default package manager, but it often includes an outdated version
3. Check versions  
   node -v
   npm -v
