CPU: Is a super-talented mathematician
Memory: The scratchpad the CPU uses to work out the math
Disk: The filing cabinet. Very slow compared to memory. Holds all the math problem worksheets and answer sheets.
GPU: It's a calculator that is good at performing a gigantic amount of simple-ish calculations all at once.
